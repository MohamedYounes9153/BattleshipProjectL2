The following code has 2 game modes:
- -f/cat: Reading a file allowing you to view a game in a table of any size, with ships of any size.
- Ability to move (be careful of collisions and mines!)
- Game taking place on a single board for 2 players.



- -i: Interactive game against a bot playing randomly in a game following the original rules of naval battle:
* 10x10 tray
* 5 ships: one 5-size ship, one 4-size ship, two 3-sized ships and one 2-size ship
* Possibility of moving your ships (be careful of collisions and mines!)
* The player and bot each have their own board, and the player also has a board displaying their shots on the opponent's board (without displaying ships).
